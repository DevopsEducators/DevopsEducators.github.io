  "body": "### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n\r\nDevOps and Rapid Deployment have quickly become established practice in large software companies. The goal of these practices is to bring smaller features to the end user faster, without sacrificing quality. They rely on a combination of choosing the right software architecture, deployment process and tool chain. While large companies have developed their current DevOps and rapid deployment methodology largely from scratch -- by training employees on the fly -- they have done this out of necessity. There is a very limited supply of experienced, knowledgeable deployment engineers to keep up the process. Similarly, small and medium sized enterprises and startups want developers trained in DevOps and Rapid Deployment principles to quickly make strides.\r\n\r\nHowever, standard university and college curricula largely skip the idea of deployment and operations, and rarely expose students to a complete continuous deployment pipeline. The goal of this one day workshop is to bring together university faculty who are interested in teaching DevOps and Rapid Deployment to share ideas and materials. There is no cost for attending the workshop but it is restricted to professional educators and prior registration is required.\r\n\r\nThe format of the workshop will be that the three organizers present their syllabi. Any attendees who have experience teaching this material are also encouraged to present. We also hope to get industry representatives to present the industrial needs. After the presentations, there will be in depth discussions of topics related to instructional issues. We expect these topics will include such issues as resources available, exercises assigned, and so forth. The exact topics will be decided by the attendees after the presentations. The workshop is intended to allow attendees to share their experiences and gain advice in the teaching of DevOps and Release Engineering topics.\r\n\r\nThe three organizers have all taught courses in DevOps or Release Engineering in their respective universities. They presented a panel at the most recent Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training where it became clear that a) there was a desire to incorporate the material, b) there was a lack of knowledge of DevOps and Release Engineering and c) the materials (texts and tools) useful in teaching the material were unfamiliar to many faculty. This workshop is an attempt to build a community of faculty interested in the subject and in teaching DevOps or Release Engineering topics.\r\n\r\nTo register for the workshop, send mail to devopseducators@gmail.com with your name and affiliation.\r\n",
